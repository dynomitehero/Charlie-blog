      <h2>First Blog Post â€“ Hello World!</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> August 7, 2025</p>
      <p>Woof woof! I'm Charlie the Spaniel, and this is my blog. Today I played fetch, cuddled with Kirby, and snuck one of Daddy's socks again. I love snacks, belly rubs, and laying on my blanket. Come back soon for more of my daily adventures!</p>
